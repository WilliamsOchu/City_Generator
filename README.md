# City_Generator!

This is a  **City_Generator** script that will match the names of missionaries who signed up to corresponding missionary cities. <br/>This project is to demonstrate my flexibility with the basics of python which include variables, functions and conditionals and manipulation of strings. <br/> 
Feel free to play with it and hit me back. 
I will be modifying this as I continue to progress in my learning. 
Cheers evryone
